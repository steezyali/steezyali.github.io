🎓 Obtained my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (with focus in Robotics & Controls) from Carnegie Mellon University
🔬 My interests span machine learning, mechatronics, computer vision and speech processing

Outside of school, you can find me at the gym, trying new dishes around town, or scaling some of the local Pittsburgh hills
