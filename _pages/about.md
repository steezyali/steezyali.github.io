👨‍💻 I'm currently a final year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University

🎓 Obtained my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (with focus in Robotics & Controls) from Carnegie Mellon University

🔬 My interests span machine learning, mechatronics, computer vision and speech processing

🏋️Outside of school, you can find me weightlifting, trying new dishes around town, or reading Sci-Fi (currently on 'Stranger in a Strange Land')

My experience in engineering has given me a solid foundation in the principles of robotics, mechatronics, and machine learning, which I have applied to my internship and course work. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new developments in robotics and AI, and I'm currently challenging myself with personal projects. I'd be more than happy to discuss my background or other opportunites!

Take a look at the links above to learn more about me! :)

### Fun fact: I summited Mt. Marcy last summer, the highest point in New York State!
