Created a robot that can flatten your Amazon boxes autonomously for my electromechanical systems design class.

This project addresses the unmet need for a cost-effective and automated solution to the pressing environmental challenge of cardboard waste. The existing issues with cardboard disposal, including the difficulties posed by size and bulk, time-consuming disassembly methods, and the economic burden on municipalities and waste management systems, necessitate an innovative approach. The solution? A mechanism that aims to bridge these gaps by providing a solution that combines the efficiency of automation with cost-effectiveness, addressing the environmental imperative of reducing cardboard waste and meeting the marketdemand for sustainable practices among online shoppers and small enterprises.
