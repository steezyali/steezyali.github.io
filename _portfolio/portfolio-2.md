### Boxmania: A Robot That Automates Cardboard Waste Flattening  
**Course:** Mechatronics Applications in Mechanical Engineering (24-354)  
**Team Role:** Controls and Force Measurement Integration Lead  
**CMU Mechanical Engineering | Fall 2023**

### Introduction  
While the rise of online shopping leads to accumulative cardboard packaging waste, Boxmania addresses this problem with an automated robot that can flatten cardboard boxes in under 30 seconds — reducing manual labor, improving recycling efficiency, and supporting sustainable waste practices.This cost-effective solution would be instrumental in helping small businesses recycle their boxes while ensuring a safe and eco-friendly environment.

### Design Approach  
 Our robot performs five core tasks:

  - Detects the box
  - Cuts tape with a linear blade mechanism
  - Opens the flaps using dual-wheel actuation
  - Flattens the box against a rigid panel
  - Ejects it into a bin. The system is controlled via a microcontroller-based state machine with built-in safety redundancies such as lid interlock and error state detection

### My Contribution

My core role in this project was to lead flap opening design and automation process (non-cutting).
This involved the following:

- **Flap Opener Desgn:** Iterating through multiple designs to achieve the following prongwd prototype

### Results & Evaluation  
- **Tape Cutting Success:** 80% first-pass reliability
- **Flap Opening:**  66% reliability with optimization planned
- **Flattening:** 100% reliability
- **Total Cycle Time:** 25 seconds per box  
- **Safety & Stability:** 2x factor of safety + interlock system

Through iterative testing and user feedback, we optimized for speed, safety, and ease of maintenance. Our design uses modular subsystems and prioritizes repairability, making it suitable for real-world deployment in warehouses, dormitories, and retail environments.

### Impact & Future Work  
Boxmania fills a critical gap in the waste management tech ecosystem. Unlike industrial balers or de-palletizers, our design is compact, cost-effective, and preserves the box structure — allowing for reuse, not just recycling. Future iterations aim to expand box compatibility with different sizes, materials/textures and tapings, thus increasing automation via self-centering mechanisms and adjustable flap actuators.
