Poor posture has been proven to have adverse effects on health and wellbeing, and can
be the direct cause of chronic pain. Posture research has especially proven that these adverse
effects particularly impact office workers and students, who sit at a desk for more than 6 hours
every day. We decided to create a product that could detect posture, make
users aware of their posture, and correct that behavior for people seated at a desk. To
accomplish this goal, we decided to incorporate two sensor data streams, position of the userâ€™s
back and force exerted on the seat of the chair, to inform vibration and visual feedback to the
user. Having both distance and force data would enable the user to improve their back curvature
and seat positioning. Designing this product could provide more insight in posture enhancement
for the user, since existing products only target specific areas, such as the neck and shoulders.
Our first prototype was a proof of concept of the distance sensing system and visual feedback
using ultrasonic sensors mounted to a rail with adjustable mounts. The second prototype
included infrared position sensing, load cell weight distribution sensing, vibration motor
feedback, and further data visualization. In this prototype, the sensing, feedback, and user
interface subsystems were each in separate electrical circuits that were not interconnected. The
final design is a custom chair with adjustable infrared sensors implemented in the chair back
and and load cells in the seat for weight distribution mapping. In order to implement these
sensors, we designed mounting brackets as attachment points for the infrared sensors to be
integrated within the structure of the chair back, and the force sensors were attached beneath
the surface layer of the seat. This final product meets our design requirements of sensing
accuracy, comfort, clarity of feedback, ease of setup, and height and weight requirements.
