### Introduction  
From our extensive customer and market research, posture-related health issues, such as back pain and discomfort, are increasingly common among individuals who spend long hours seated at desks. Aiming to tackle this issue, our team designed PosChair, a device that senses posture deviations and provides corrective feedback to improve seated posture. By integrating multiple sensors, including infrared (IR) sensors for back position and load cells for weight distribution, PosChair provides real-time feedback to help users adjust their seating position. This project was born out of a desire to offer a low-cost, effective solution for office workers, students, and anyone in need of posture correction.

### Design Approach  
PosChair is equipped with dual sensor arrays: an infrared sensor system that detects the user's back position and angle, and load cells integrated into the seat to assess pressure distribution and detect slouching. The chair incorporates vibration motors that provide feedback when poor posture is detected, alerting the user to make necessary adjustments. The custom chair design ensures user comfort while integrating sensors and feedback mechanisms seamlessly into the structure.

### Results & Evaluation  
- **Sensing Accuracy:** IR sensors achieved an error margin of 2 cm, ensuring precise back angle measurement.  
- **Load Cell Sensitivity:** Successfully mapped pressure distribution, with a maximum weight detection of 110 lbs per cell.  
- **Feedback Effectiveness:** Vibration feedback was effective in alerting users of poor posture, with customizable intensity levels for different postural deviations.  
- **User Comfort:** The product met comfort ratings of 8-10/10, with minimal intrusion into the user's daily routine.  
- **System Integration:** All subsystems (sensing, feedback, and interface) were successfully integrated and tested in tandem, ensuring seamless user interaction.

Despite challenges in sensor calibration and integration, including the adjustment of load cells and fine-tuning the motor feedback, the product successfully met its functional goals.

### Impact & Future Work  
PosChair offers a holistic approach to posture correction by addressing multiple areas of the body and providing continuous feedback. Compared to existing market solutions, such as wearable posture devices or expensive ergonomic chairs, PosChair stands out due to its comprehensive feedback system, affordability (~$275), and ease of setup. Future iterations could include enhancements like adaptive feedback, additional sensor calibration, and wireless connectivity for data tracking. With further refinement, PosChair could be a valuable tool for individuals seeking long-term posture improvement.
