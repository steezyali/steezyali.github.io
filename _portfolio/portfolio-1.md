Inspired by the peregrine falcon, this project investigates a novel two-joint variable-sweep wing system. By emulating the natural wing morphing mechanisms of a peregrine falcon, an aircraft wing configuration was designed/manufactured, featuring a two-joint wing system capable of zero joint actuation (fixed wing), single joint actuation, and double joint actuation.
