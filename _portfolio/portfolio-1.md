| WHAT | HOW | RESULTS |
|------|-----|---------|
| - Designed and **prototyped** a variable-sweep wing system that features fixed wing, single and double jointed rotations<br> - Designed mechatronics layout and implemented/calibrated efficient SD data card logging, vibration and altimeter sensors<br> - Conducted **flight testing analysis** to determine motor parameters (speed, torque) | - Used **Fusion360** to design chassis and components for robot <br> - Fabricated chassis components using **Laser Cutting** and **3D Printing** <br> - Applied **DFMA** techniques to minimize the number of 3D parts to reduce fabrication lead times | - Robot successfully processed a cardboard box in **25s** <br> - Improved system reliability to **80%** by applying FMEA techniques |

## Context
Inspired by the peregrine falcon, this project investigates a novel two-joint variable-sweep wing system. By emulating the natural wing morphing mechanisms of a peregrine falcon, an aircraft wing configuration was designed/manufactured, featuring a two-joint wing system capable of zero joint actuation (fixed wing), single joint actuation, and double joint actuation.
